                    communities still have ongoing building &amp;
                    construction work in progress, over which we have no

                  <p align="justify">PatricksVilla can not accept
                    responsibility for third party claims, accidents,
                    damage to, or loss of property, or for any expenses

                  <p align="justify">15. POOL&nbsp; HEATING<br>
                    Due to the nature of the prevailing weather systems
                    in the sub-tropical climate of Florida,
                    PatricksVilla cannot guarantee the water temperature
                    in the swimming pool. The pool heater is set and
                    locked to standard water temperatures. The heater is
                    set to operate at set standard hours during the day,
                    this is to ensure that guests paying for the heating
                    service get the optimum benefit from the heating at
                    normal times, and that we comply with the operating
                    requirements of the system as laid down by the
                    manufactures. The actual water temperature will vary
                    with the ambient temperature, time of use and
                    prevailing weather conditions. PatricksVilla will
                    NOT enter into any discussions concerning complaints
                    regarding pool temperatures, therefore Guests
                    booking pool heating do so at their own risk. </p>
                  <p align="justify">16. NON-SMOKING POLICY<br>

                    villa. Smoking is permitted in the pool deck area,
                    and ash trays are provided for this purpose. Any

                    leaving. The owners of PatricksVilla will charge for
                    any extra cleaning and this will be deducted from
                    the Guests Security Deposit. </p>
