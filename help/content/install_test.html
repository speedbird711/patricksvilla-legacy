         To 
test&nbsp;that SimpleSecure is working,             
           
           
         you need to create a recipient record and 
then send&nbsp;yourself a test message.&nbsp;           
           
  </p>
<P><EM>For full details on Recipient Records and&nbsp;how&nbsp;they work, refer 
to the usage instructions.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>Step One: Edit The Test Recipient</STRONG></P>
<P>Edit the "Test Form" recipient record.&nbsp; Scroll down 
to the "Recipients" field and replace the dummy email address with your own real address.</P>
<P>In the "From" field, replace the dummy address with the address of your 
choice.</P>
<P>Click "Update" to update the recipient record.&nbsp; Now, any form with 
cfgId=1 will be sent to you.</P>
<P><STRONG>Step Two: Submit a Test Form</STRONG></P>
<P> The fastest way to test SimpleSecure without creating a dummy form is 
to manually enter some test data in the brower Address Bar.&nbsp; Anything 
that includes cfgId=1 in the querystring will work.&nbsp; The following is a 
recommendation:</P>
<P><A 
href="/cgi-bin/ssecure/ssecure.pl?cfgId=1&amp;Message=Test+Message" >http://www.YOURDOMAIN.com/cgi-bin/ssecure/ssecure.pl?cfgId=1&amp;Message=Test+Message</A></P>
<P>If everything is working correctly, you should see the 
message "Thank you.&nbsp; Your information has been submitted."
Check your email at this time.&nbsp; You should receive a message from the 
server.</P>
<P>You may also use a test form like the one below.&nbsp; (you will probably 
need to update the action tag to point to the correct location on your 
server.)</P>

<form action="/cgi-bin/ssecure/ssecure.pl" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" id=form1 name=form1>
<input type="hidden" name="cfgId" value="1">
<table border="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr><td>Name</td><td><input name="Name" ></td></tr>
<tr><td>Email</td><td><input name="cfgFrom" ></td></tr>
<tr><td>Resume</td><td><input type="file" name="Resume"></td></tr>
</table>
<p><input type="submit" value="Test Form"></p>
</form>

<P>NOTE: Many spam filters will intercept automated email messages.&nbsp; 
Because all formmail messages are, by their nature, an automated message, your 
spam filter may block the message.&nbsp; If you do not receive the SimpleSecure 
test message within a few moments, check that it did not get filtered.&nbsp; To 
workaround this problem, you may need to specify the "From" address of the 
recipient record as an email address that is on your spam filter whitelist.</P>    
 
  <P><STRONG>Refer to the 
troubleshooting page if you have any problems with the 
install...</STRONG>
