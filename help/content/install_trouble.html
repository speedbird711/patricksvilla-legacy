<STRONG>SERVER ERROR: Server 500 Error:</STRONG>        
             
           
           
                 
               
           
  </p>
<P>A server 500 error means that the script failed to 
compile correctly.&nbsp; A 500 error basically means "Unknown Error" and so, 
there are many possible causes.&nbsp; Here are the top causes for a 500 error.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>The script or any of it's required modules was 
  uploaded in binary mode instead of ASCII mode.
  <LI>The file permission on the script is not set 
  correctly to allow read/execute.
  <LI>A required Perl module is missing.
  <LI>The path to Perl&nbsp;is incorrect&nbsp;on the first line of the 
  script.</LI></OL>
<P>The best way to trouble-shoot is to login to the server via SSH and execute 
the script from the command line.&nbsp; The perl interpreter should give you 
more details about the error and allow you to fix it.</P>
<P>So that you don't spend time chasing the wrong problem, below are some things 
that gererally do NOT cause 500 errors:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Wrong permission on datafiles (the script will detect 
  and alert you) .
  <LI>Incorrect admin passwords, cfgIds, etc.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Script Error: Could not write/open file:</STRONG></P>
  <P>SimpleSecure has error checking to make sure it can 
read/write from it's datafiles.&nbsp; If you receive an error about a permission 
problem, then you must correct it on the server.&nbsp; The script should 
generally tell you which file it tried to read/write and that should help you to 
fix the problem.          
            </P>
<P><STRONG>PGP/GPG: Encryption Errors:</STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The possible causes of GPG/PGP errors are so numerous that it is impossible 
to get into them here.&nbsp; Generally the encrypted email message will contain 
some information that could help you to debug the problem.</P>
<P>If you have a PGP/GPG attachment and it doesn't decrypt sucessfully, try 
opening it in Notepad.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an encryption error occurs, instead of 
the expected PGP data, the attachment will actually contain text with error 
details.</P>
