<p title="SimpleSecure 3.0 README">SimpleSecure is an 
advanced form processing script written in Perl to run on Windows and UNIX 
servers.&nbsp; SimpleSecure supports an unlimited number of forms (within the limits of the 
server) with no limitation as to the fields or types of information 
you are collecting.&nbsp; originally based on Matt Wright's FormMail script, SimpleSecure 3.0 has been written from
the ground up with security and flexibility in mind.</p>
<P>     
            
        
 SimpleSecure supports&nbsp;encrypted messages using PGP, GPG, RC4 or JMH.&nbsp; 
Perl developers have the ability to add additional encryption methods.&nbsp; messages 
may also be sent in plain text,&nbsp;making&nbsp;SimpleSecure ae easy,&nbsp;practical solution for 
non-secure form processing needs as well.</P>
<P>     
            
        
          
  SimpleSecure supports file uploads and will include them in 
the email as an attachment.&nbsp; The number of attachments per message&nbsp;is 
limited only by the server capabilities.</P>
<P>    SimpleSecure supports Sendmail and SMTP for 
email transmission, making it suitable for various types of server situations.</P>



<P class="bold">installation instructions</P>

<p>IMPORTANT! all files (except the .gif files) must be uploaded in ASCII mode.  most 
FTP clients are set to use "Auto" mode by default and 
will not upload the files correctly.  Uploading in BINARY
mode will cause the application to work incorrectly or
not at all.  You should manually specify ASCII mode on
your FTP client.</p>
<OL>
  <LI>download and unzip the distribution file.&nbsp; if you 
  are on a UNIX server only, open ssecure.pl and verify that the top line is 
  the correct&nbsp;path&nbsp;for Perl.&nbsp; the default setting is /usr/local/bin/perl&nbsp; change 
  this only if neccessary.&nbsp; "which perl" at the shell prompt will tell you 
  the proper location of perl. 
  <LI>upload all files from your local computer&nbsp;to your web server.&nbsp; be 
  sure to use ASCII mode for all files (except the .gif files)&nbsp;and preserve the 
  directory structure.&nbsp; the directory ssecure should be uploaded to your 
  html&nbsp;root directory and the files inside cgi-bin should be uploaded to your cgi-bin 
  directory. 
  <LI>Change the file permissions:</LI>
  <OL>
    <LI>For UNIX Servers, use either the chmod command at the shell prompt, or 
    use your FTP software to execute the chmod command (ex. "chmod 606 
    filename.txt").&nbsp; Using WS_FTP, this is done by right-clicking on the 
    file and selecting "chmod" from the pop-up menu.</LI>
    <UL>
    <LI>cgi-bin/ssecure.pl = 705&nbsp; (rwx---r-x) 
    <LI>cgi-bin/data/* = 606 (rw----rw-)&nbsp; (* 
      indicates all files in  this directory) 
    <LI>cgi-bin/temp/ = 707 (rwx---rwx)</LI></UL>
    <LI>Windows Users - file permissions may not apply on your server.&nbsp; If 
    you have access to the windows operating system, you can change the NTFS 
    permissions through windows explorer.&nbsp; IIS also has it's own set of 
    permissions.&nbsp; If you have a web-based control panel, refer to it's 
    documentation or help files for changing permissions.&nbsp; The web server 
    account needs to have the following permissions:</LI>
    <UL>
      <LI>cgi-bin/ssecure.pl = 705&nbsp; (Read/Execute) 
      <LI>cgi-bin/data/* = 606 (Read/Write)&nbsp;&nbsp; (* indicates all files 
      in this directory)
      <LI>cgi-bin/temp/ = 707 (Read/Write/Execute)</LI></UL></OL>
  <LI>open your browser to&nbsp;/cgi-bin/ssecure.pl if 
  installation was successful, you should be greeted with a login screen.&nbsp; 
  enter "admin" for the username and "admin" for the password. 
  <LI>if all file permissions are correct, you should see the main configuration 
  screen.&nbsp; proceed to useage instructions.</LI></OL>
<P><STRONG>the general idea</STRONG>:</P>
<P>the general idea is that you create an html form with the action property set 
to&nbsp;ssecure.pl.&nbsp; your user fills out the information on this form and 
clicks the submit button.&nbsp; their responses are processed by 
ssecure.pl&nbsp;and sent to you as an email message.&nbsp; SimpleSecure doesn't 
particularly care what fields are on your form.&nbsp; it simply processes 
whatever information is received and converts it to an email message.&nbsp; the 
only exception are fields that begin with "cfg"&nbsp; any fields that begins 
with "cfg" is considered a configuration variable and is not included in the 
email message.</P>
<P><STRONG>how SimpleSecure differs from other form 
processors</STRONG>             
             
             
            
              
            
             
            
         
</P>
<P>old form processors (such has FormMail) require a hidden field to specify the 
recipient of the email message, as well as other settings, such as subject, 
email format, etc.&nbsp; this is a convenient approach, as you can support any 
form with any recipient and no configuration of the script is required.&nbsp; 
the problem with this system is that anyone can create a form with any 
recipient, allowing just about anyone to "hijack" the usage of your FormMail 
script.&nbsp; also, the email address to which the message is being sent is 
easily viewable in the source of the HTML.&nbsp; email harvesters aside, it 
may&nbsp;be undesireable&nbsp;to have the email address easily available to 
everyone.</P>
<P>newer and more secure scripts have been created to address this issue, 
however many require actually editing the script to add or change the email 
recipients.&nbsp; some scripts allow you to designate a list of "ok" email 
recipients, while others have you create configuration files for each form.</P>
<P>the SimpleSecure approach is to create a "recipient" of one or more email 
addresses.&nbsp; each recipient&nbsp;record is&nbsp;assigned a 
unique&nbsp;ID.&nbsp; on the html form, instead of specifying your email 
address, you merely specify the ID number in a hidden form 
field.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your email address is not required in the source, nor can it 
be changed through a hidden form field.&nbsp; settings such as message format, 
subject and redirect page can also be specified through the administration 
panel, so you do not need to include a bunch of hidden variables on every 
form.&nbsp; however, you can override the non-security-related settings with 
hidden fields if you choose.&nbsp; in this way one "recipient" record can 
support any number of forms.</P>
<P>recipient records&nbsp;are added and managed&nbsp;through the web-based 
administration panel.&nbsp; only those with the&nbsp;administrator 
username/password&nbsp;can access the administration panel.&nbsp; in addition to 
all of the typical form processor settings, SimpleSecure also supports various 
methods of encryption.&nbsp; message encryption settings can also be controlled 
through the admin panel.</P>
<P><STRONG>setup &amp; administration</STRONG></P>
<P>
<IMG alt=SimpleSecure src="images/screenshot.simplesecure.gif" align=right border=0 width="350" height="331" >
once you have installed SimpleSecure, you should direct your browser to the 
location of ssecure.pl on your server.&nbsp; you will be presented with the 
login screen.&nbsp; if this is your first time logging in, the default 
username/password is admin/admin.&nbsp; the first thing you should do is to 
change this password.</P>
<P>There are Four main links at the top of the administration section: 
Recipients, System Settings, System Information and Logout.&nbsp; The System 
Settings link is the primary one of interest for setup and administration.&nbsp; 
Recipients are discussed in the usage section below.&nbsp; System Information is 
an informational page only and logout is self-explainitory.</P>
<P>Clicking on the System Settings link brings up several configuration 
settings.&nbsp; These control the operation of the script.&nbsp; If you have 
followed all of the instructions correctly, the only screen that you absolutely 
have to check is the Email screen.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>General:</STRONG> This is 
  where you specify the admin username/password as well as the temporary 
  directory that SimpleSubmit can use for writing temporary files. 
  <LI><STRONG>Email:</STRONG> This 
  screen allows you to specify a path to the recipients database (not 
  recommended to change) as well as the server settings for sending email.&nbsp; 
  At this screen you should specify if SMTP or Sendmail is to be used, and the 
  server or file path that is required. 
  <LI><STRONG>Ecryption Settings:</STRONG> This screen is where you specify the paths to PGP, GPG 
  executables as well as a URL for&nbsp;your JMH Web Services. 
  <LI><STRONG>Display:</STRONG> This 
  controls the design style of SimpleSecure.&nbsp; You can edit the CSS code as 
  required. 
  <LI><STRONG>Defaults:</STRONG> This page allows you to restore the default 
  settings, or redefine the default settings.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>form processing</STRONG></P>
<P>
<IMG alt=SimpleSecure src="images/simplesecure.example.gif" align=right border=1 width="265" height="163" >
the first step in using SimpleSecure is to login to the administration panel 
and create a new "recipient" record.&nbsp; the recipient detail screen several 
fields, but most are quite simple and each has some brief explaination 
text.&nbsp; once you create&nbsp;your new recipient, you will be presented 
with&nbsp;sample html code that can be used as a starting point for your 
form.&nbsp; Although extremely simple, this html&nbsp;contains&nbsp;the basic 
code needed for all forms.&nbsp; notice, in particular, the hidden variable 
cfgId, which specifies the recipient record to be used.</P>
<P>your form can contain as many additional fields as you like.&nbsp; any field 
that does not begin with "cfg" will be processed by ssecure.pl and included in 
the email message.&nbsp; text boxes, text areas, dropdown boxes, checkboxes, 
radion buttons, etc, can all be used on your form.&nbsp; The presentation of the 
email message can be controlled by simply naming your form fields 
appropriately.&nbsp; your form can also contain file upload fields.&nbsp; file 
uploads will be processed by ssecure.pl and&nbsp;included in the email message 
as an attachment.&nbsp; if you have an upload field on your form, however, it is 
required that the form tag&nbsp;include the setting 
enctype="multipart/form-data"&nbsp; if you have forgotten this setting, only the 
filename (not the actual file contents) will be processed and sent in the email 
message.</P>
