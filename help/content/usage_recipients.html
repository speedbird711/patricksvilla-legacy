         Typical form processors allow you to 
specify the email recipient as a hidden variable in the form, or else you must 
configure recipient in the script itself.</P>
<P>SimpleSecure uses a slightly different 
approach&nbsp;that allows for&nbsp;both flexibility&nbsp;and security.&nbsp; 
When you create a new HTML form, you also create a 
corresponding "Recipient" Record for that form.&nbsp; The Recipient Record allows you 
to specify to whom the message will be sent, encryption settings, etc.</P>
<P>On your HTML form, you include a hidden variable with name="cfgId".&nbsp; The 
value refers to the Recipient Record Id.&nbsp; When SimpleSecure processes the 
form, it will use the settings specified for the provided Recipient Record.</P>
<P>One Recipient Record can support an unlimited number of 
HTML forms, so long as the intended receiver of the formmail message is the 
same.&nbsp; You need an additional Recipient Record for each actual person/email to which a 
form will be sent.</P>
<P>For Single-Site installation, this means that you will probably only need to 
configure one (1) recipient record.&nbsp; If you are hosting multiple sites, or 
providing secure form processing for various people, you simply create a 
Recipient Record for each client.&nbsp; You provide that client with thier 
Recipient Record ID.&nbsp; Then, they may create as many forms as they like, so 
long as they use the correct cfgId on their form.</P>
<P><STRONG>Recipient Record &amp; Form&nbsp;Settings:</STRONG></P>
<P>The following fields are available for 
each&nbsp;Recipient Record &amp; Form.&nbsp; Those setting that have an HTML 
Fieldname can be specified on the HTML form itself.&nbsp; The default setting 
for the Recipient Record will be used unless an override setting is specified on the form.</P>
<P>Any HTML form field that begins with the letters 'cfg' 
will be considered a configuration setting and will not be included in the email message.</P>
