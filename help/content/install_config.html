         SimpleSecure includes a        
             
           
           
         web-based administration panel that allows you to control 
all of the runtime settings.           
           
  </p>
<P>To open the administration panel, direct&nbsp;your browser to:</P>
<P><A 
href="https://www.YOURDOMAIN.com/cgi-bin/ssecure/ssecure.pl" >https://www.YOURDOMAIN.com/cgi-bin/ssecure/ssecure.pl</A></P>
<P>The default login information is:</P>
<P>Username = admin<BR>Password =   admin</P>
<P>

<STRONG>Step One: Change The Admin Password</STRONG></P>
<P>         
  For security reasons, it is recommeded 
that you first change the administrator password.&nbsp;</P>
<P>To change the password, click on the "System Settings" navigation link.&nbsp; The "General" 
tab of the System Settings page contains the admin username/password&nbsp; (see 
screenshot).&nbsp; You should update this to a username/password of your 
choice.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=red>ATTENTION: It is not recommeded to use the same 
password for SimpleSecure&nbsp;that you use for your FTP or Host account.&nbsp; 
This is a poor security practice!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Step Two: Specify the Email Method</STRONG></P>
<P>The "Email" tab on the System Settings page is where you 
must specify the method that SimpleSecure will use to send email messages.&nbsp; 
The two supported methods are SENDMAIL and SMTP.&nbsp; If you choose Sendmail, 
then you must also enter the path to sendmail on your server (ex 
"/usr/bin/sendmail").&nbsp; If you choose SMTP, then you must also enter the 
address of the SMTP server (ex "localhost" or "smtp.mydomain.com").</P>

<STRONG>Step Three: Configure GPG/PGP Path:</STRONG></P>
<P>(This step is only necessary if you plan to use the encryption features of 
SimpleSecure)</P>
<P>The "Encrypting Settings" tab of the System Settings page contains fields for PGP and 
GPG&nbsp; (see screenshot).</P>
<P>GPG &amp; PGP Executable paths should be something like "/usr/bin/pgp" or 
"/usr/bin/gpg".&nbsp; If your site is hosted&nbsp;on a Windows server, The path 
may be something like "C:/Program Files/PGP/pgp.exe"&nbsp; (In the case of 
Windows servers, leave the quotes around the path).</P>
<P>The Keyring path can be configured in two ways.</P>
<P>A. (recommended).&nbsp; Specify the full path to th e ~/cgi-bin/ssecure/keys 
directory.&nbsp; (for example 
"/usr/www/public_html/myaccount/cgi-bin/ssecure/keys")&nbsp; Use the same value 
for both GPG and PGP keyring path.</P>
<P>B. (advanced).&nbsp; If you already have a location where you store GPG/PGP 
keyrings, you may specify the full path here.&nbsp; (for example 
"/usr/home/myaccount/.pgp").&nbsp; If you decide to configure the path this way, 
you must also allow world-read access to your keyring folder.</P>
<P><STRONG>SimpleSecure is now configured and ready to test...</STRONG></P>
